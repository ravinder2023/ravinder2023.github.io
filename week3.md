# Week 3: Database Administration

In the realm of IT infrastructure, databases serve as the backbone for storing, organizing, and retrieving data critical to business operations. Whether you're setting up a small-scale application or managing enterprise-level systems, mastering database management on Linux is essential. This guide covers key aspects including Database Installation and Configuration, Database Design, Database Security, Backup and Recovery, and Data Migration and Integration.
Database Installation and Configuration

## Installing and configuring databases on Linux systems requires careful planning and execution:

    Choosing the Right Database: Select a database system suitable for your application needs (e.g., MySQL/MariaDB, PostgreSQL, MongoDB).
    Installation: Use package managers (apt, yum) to install database server software and dependencies.
    Configuration: Configure database settings such as storage paths, memory allocation, and networking parameters (my.cnf for MySQL/MariaDB).

## Database Design

### Effective database design ensures efficient data storage and retrieval:

    Schema Design: Design logical and physical schemas to organize data into tables, views, and indexes.
    Normalization: Apply normalization techniques to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.
    Indexing: Create indexes to optimize query performance and facilitate data retrieval.

## Database Security

### Securing databases on Linux systems is crucial to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access:

    Authentication: Configure strong authentication mechanisms (password policies, SSH keys) for database access.
    Authorization: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict privileges based on user roles.
    Encryption: Encrypt data at rest (database files) and in transit (using TLS/SSL) to prevent eavesdropping.

## Backup and Recovery

### Implementing robust backup and recovery strategies ensures data availability and integrity:

    Backup Types: Schedule regular backups (full, incremental, differential) using tools like mysqldump or database-specific backup utilities.
    Recovery Procedures: Test backup integrity and practice recovery scenarios to minimize downtime in case of data loss or corruption.
    Automated Backup: Use cron jobs or scheduling tools to automate backup tasks and ensure consistency.

## Data Migration and Integration

### Efficient data migration and integration facilitate seamless data flow across different systems:

    ETL (Extract, Transform, Load): Use ETL tools or scripts (Python, Bash) to extract data from various sources, transform it as needed, and load it into the database.
    Data Synchronization: Implement synchronization techniques (e.g., CDC - Change Data Capture) to keep databases in sync across environments.
    API Integration: Integrate databases with external applications using APIs (RESTful APIs, SOAP) for data exchange and interoperability.
